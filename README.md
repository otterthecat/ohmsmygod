# Ohms My God!!!
Demo of simple LED circuit w/ JS

For now, it's text/console only. The idea is to keep taking it a litter further
until it oozes awesome from it's pores.

Yes, this is a work in progress, so all the caveats that would normally apply go with it.

## Great, I'm in! What do I do?
Download the repo and launch the `public/index.html` in a browser.

Green button turns on the circuit.
Red button turns off the circuit (if you're color blind, just button mash until something happens.)

Slider will change the total resistance. If things are happy, you'll see a display that the light is shining.

If you're a sadist, you may want to try bringing the resistance under 150...
